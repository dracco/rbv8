rbv8 -- A Ruby VM running on Google V8 super VM.

V8 (http://code.google.com/p/v8/) is running Javascript,
a highly dynamic language, faster then fast.
Ruby is a super highly dynamic language too!

Lets see ...

== TODO
This is a prototype! If this project seems cool enough, a complete refactoring
will be required.

* Remove dependency over YARV parser and bytecode emitter by porting to js.
* ...
